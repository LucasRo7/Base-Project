# Base-Project
My base project, I use it as base to create most of my projects.
You can also download it and modify it to create your own projects, 
be it a game, a simulator, a physics test, a movie player, anything!

#Example
[Example implementation of Main class](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ezsddtooofzuwnz/)

#Why use Unlicence as my licence?
I'm using it because i've seen all other licences and i just really 
wanted that anyone that found my code were able to copy it and use it.
Although it doesnt have any conditions, letting me be aware that you
used my base project for something is appreciated ;D
